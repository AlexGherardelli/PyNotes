    "## Definition of recursion\n",
    "A recursive function is a fuction that call itself. Everything is handled by a call stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time a function call is made, a new frame object with information related to the call (such as local variables and a return address for the execution to move to when the function returns) is added to the call stack. The call stack, being a stack data structure, can be altered only by having data added to or removed from its “top.” This is called pushing to and popping from the stack, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack is handled by the program implicitly, so there is no call stack variable. Calling a function pushes a frame object to the call stack, and returning from a function pops a frame object from the call stack. Recursive functions have recursive cases, those in which a recursive call is made, and base cases, those where the function simply returns. If there is no base case or a bug prevents a base case from being run, the execution causes a stack overflow that crashes the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three features of a programming problem, when present,\n",
    "make it especially suitable to a recursive approach:\n",
    "- It involves a tree-like structure.\n",
    "- It involves backtracking.\n",
    "- It isn’t so deeply recursive as to potentially cause a stack overflow."
